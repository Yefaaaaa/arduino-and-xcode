### Arduino
Arduino is an open-source project that created microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control physical devices.

The video simply shows how the Arduino works and what the date are expecting from the sound detector. If you can receive the data from both serial monitor windows, congratulation, your Arduino board configuration is done.

### Xcode
Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, WatchOS and tvOS.

This source code is available online. I make a little bit modifies which simplifies the code and change the interface. This code only works in the IOS 10 system, which is currently use in the iPhone.
